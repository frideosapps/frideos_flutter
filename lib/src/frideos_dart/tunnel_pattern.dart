/// Used to make a one-way tunnel beetween two blocs (from blocA to a StremedValue on blocB).
/// 
/// #### Usage:
/// 
/// 1 - Define a streamed object (e.g. [StreamedValue]) in the blocB
/// 
/// ```dart
/// final receiverStr = StreamedValue<String>();
/// ```
/// 
/// 2 - Define a [StreamedSender] in the blocA
/// 
/// ```dart
/// final tunnelSenderStr = StreamedSender<String>();
/// ```
///
/// 
/// 3 - Set the receiver in the sender on the class the holds the instances of the blocs
/// 
/// ```dart/// 
/// blocA.tunnelSenderStr.setReceiver(blocB.receiverStr);
/// ```
/// 
/// 4 - To send data from blocA to bloc B then:
/// 
/// ```dart
/// tunnelSenderStr.send("Text from blocA to blocB");
/// ```

/// Like the StreamedSender, but used with lists.

/// #### Usage 
///
/// 1 - Define a [StreamedList] object in the blocB
///
/// ```dart
///   final receiverList = StreamedList<int>();
/// ```
///
/// 2 - Define a [ListSender] in the blocA
///
/// ```dart
///   final tunnelList = ListSender<int>();
/// ```
///
/// 3 - Set the receiver in the sender on the class the holds
///   the instances of the blocs
///
/// ```dart
///   blocA.tunnelList.setReceiver(blocB.receiverList);
/// ```
///
/// 4 - To send data from blocA to bloc B then:
///
/// ```dart
///   tunnelList.send(list);
/// ```

/// #### Usage

/// 1 - Define a [StreamedMap]object in the blocB
///
/// ```dart
///   final receiverMap = StreamedMap<int, String>();
/// ```
///
/// 2 - Define a [MapSender] in the blocA
///
/// ```dart
///   final tunnelMap = MapSender<int, String>();
/// ```
///
/// 3 - Set the receiver in the sender on the class the holds
///   the instances of the blocs
///
/// ```dart
///   blocA.tunnelMap.setReceiver(blocB.receiverMap);
/// ```
